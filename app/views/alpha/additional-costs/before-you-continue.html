        <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">What you’ll need to make a claim</h1>

        <p>You’ll need to send a claim for each type of support you get. For example, if you use a British Sign Language interpreter and have a driver, you’ll need to send 2 claims.</p>

        <p>If different people or companies paid for your support, you'll also need to send separate claims for each. </p>

        <h3 class="govuk-body">You’ll need:</h3>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-list--spaced">
            <li>the dates you had support
            </li>
            <li>to tell us how many hours of support you had on each date
            </li>
            <li>the name and email address of the person or company who we can ask to confirm the support you’re claiming for </li>
            <li>the details of the person or company we need to pay, including bank details if we’ve not paid them before</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="govuk-inset-text">
        The person or company we need to pay could be anyone who paid for your support worker costs. This includes yourself, a friend, a family member, or your employer.
        </div>

        <p>You’ll need to send us an invoice or receipt for any support worker costs you’re claiming for.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you're self-employed or work at the same organisation as the person providing the support</h2>

        <p>You’ll need to send us a digital copy of a signed timesheet or payslip for the person who provided your support.</p>
