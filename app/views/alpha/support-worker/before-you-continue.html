        <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">What you will need to make a claim</h1>


        <h3 class="govuk-body">You will need to tell us:</h3>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-list--spaced">
            <li>the dates you had support
            </li>
            <li>how many hours of support you had on each date
            </li>
            <li>the details of the person or company we need to pay - this can be you, a family member, friend, employer or anyone who paid for your support worker costs</li>
            <li>the name, address, email and bank details of any new person or company we haven't paid before</li>
        </ul>



        <p>You will need to send a separate claim for each type of support you get. For example, if you use a British Sign Language interpreter and have a driver, you will need to send 2 claims.</p>

        <p>If different people or companies paid for your support, you'll also need to send separate claims for each. </p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How to confirm your claim</h2>

        <p>You will need to give us:

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-list--spaced">
                <li>the name and email address of the person or company we can ask to confirm the support
                </li>
                <li>an invoice or receipt for any support worker costs you claim for
                </li>
            </ul>

<p>If you are self-employed or work at the same organisation as the person providing support, you will need to send us a digital copy of a signed timesheet or payslip for the person who provided your support.</p>
